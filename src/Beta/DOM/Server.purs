import React.Basic (JSX)

-- | Render a React element to its initial HTML. React will return an HTML string.
-- | You can use this method to generate HTML on the server and send the markup
-- | down on the initial request for faster page loads and to allow search engines
-- | to crawl your pages for SEO purposes.
-- |
-- | If you call `ReactDOM.hydrate` on a node that already has this server-rendered
-- | markup, React will preserve it and only attach event handlers, allowing you to
-- | have a very performant first-load experience.
foreign import renderToString :: JSX -> String

-- | Similar to `renderToString`, except this doesnâ€™t create extra DOM attributes
-- | that React uses internally, such as `data-reactroot`. This is useful if you
-- | want to use React as a simple static page generator, as stripping away the
-- | extra attributes can save some bytes.
-- |
-- | If you plan to use React on the client to make the markup interactive, do not
-- | use this method. Instead, use `renderToString` on the server and `ReactDOM.hydrate`
-- | on the client.
